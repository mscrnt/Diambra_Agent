GitHub Copilot: Certainly! Let's go through each file and its purpose in detail:

## training.py

`training.py` is the main script for training a reinforcement learning agent for a video game using the Stable Baselines3 library. The script imports various modules and classes from the Stable Baselines3 library, as well as some custom modules and classes defined in this repository. 

The script loads settings and parameters from the `config.py` file, creates a game environment using the `make_sb3_env` function, and trains a PPO agent using the `PPO` class. The trained agent is saved to disk as a ZIP file.

The `make_sb3_env` function creates a game environment using the `gym.make` function from the OpenAI Gym library. The function takes a game ID as an argument and returns a game environment object. The `PPO` class is a reinforcement learning algorithm implemented in the Stable Baselines3 library.

## config.py

`config.py` is a configuration file containing various settings and parameters for the training process. The file defines a dictionary called `settings` that contains settings related to the game environment, such as the game ID, the observation space, and the action space. 

The file also defines a dictionary called `ppo_settings` that contains settings related to the PPO algorithm, such as the learning rate and the number of training steps. Finally, the file defines a dictionary called `wrappers_settings` that contains settings related to custom wrappers that modify the game environment.

## custom_wrapper.py

`custom_wrapper.py` is a custom wrapper class for modifying the game environment. The class defines a `CustomWrapper` class that inherits from the `gym.Wrapper` class and overrides some of its methods to modify the game environment. 

The class can be used to add or remove observations, modify rewards, or perform other custom modifications to the game environment.

## mscrnt_utils.py

`mscrnt_utils.py` is a utility module containing various helper functions.

The functions can be used by the `training.py` script or other scripts that interact with the game environment.
